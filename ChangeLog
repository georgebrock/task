# Tracked Bugs, sorted by ID.
 + Fixed bug #208, which addresses various problems with recurring tasks, and
   change propagation.

   (thanks to Andreas Kalex).
 + Fixed bug #511, which caused display problem on Cygwin when colored output

   report column (thanks to Duane Waddle).
 + Fixed bug #761, in which the 'prepend' and 'append' commands failed to
   generate an error when no text was provided (thanks to Aikido Guy).
 + Fixed bug #762, #763, so that modifications to tasks are considered 'write'
   commands, and therefore update shadow files (thanks to Aikido Guy).
 + Applied patch for Bug #770, which fixed a broken build (thanks to Christopher
   J. Pilkington).
 + Applied patch for Bug #771, which looks for libuuid if uuid_unparse_lower is
   not located (thanks to Christopher J. Pilkington).

   (thanks to Owen Clarke).
 + Fixed bug #808, which generated compiler warnings on Solarix (thanks to
   Owen Clarke).

   have completed dependencies, and problems when editing those tasks (thanks
   to Matt Kraai).

   Gour D).
 + Fixed bug #846, which prevented the default.command configuration from
   handling multiple arguments (thanks to Uli Martens).

1.9.1 (5/22/2010) 60a99725b858be134ad538cb7c1a32c98de70e67
 + Summary report bar colors can now be specified with color.summary.bar

   Good Friday (goodfriday), Easter (easter), Easter monday
   (eastermonday), Ascension (ascension), Pentecost (pentecost)
   The date is configured with the given keyword.

   message when called without an ID.
 + Fixed bug #402 which failed compilation on Arch Linux (thanks to
   Johannes Schlatow).
 + Fixed bug #401 that ignored the search.case.sensitive configuration
   setting when filtering on project names (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #395 that prevented the upgrade of a pending task to a
   recurring task (thanks to T. Charles Yun).

1.9.0 (2/22/2010) dd758f8b33de110a633e2ff3ebdac73232b8ff44
 + Added feature #283 that makes it possible to control the verbosity
   of the output of annotations.
 + Added feature #254 (#295) which gives task a second date format to be
   used in the reports with more conversion sequences like weekday name
   or weeknumber. The date format is set with variable "dateformat.report".
 + Added feature #292 that permits alternate line coloration in reports
   (thanks to Richard Querin).
 + Added feature #307 that provides vim with syntax highlighting for .taskrc.
 + Added feature #336 which gives task a 'prepend' command for symmetry
   with the 'append' command.
 + Added feature #341 that makes explicit references to the task and taskrc
   man pages, both in the auto-generated .taskrc file and the version command
   output (thanks to Cory Donnelly).
 + The 'delete' command is now aliased to 'rm' (thanks to Ivo Jimenez).
 + Added new attribute modifiers 'word' and 'noword' which find the existence
   of whole words, or prove the non-existence of whole words.  If a task has
   the description "Pay the bill", then "description.word:the" will match, but
   "description.word:th" will not.  For partial word matches, there is still
   "description.contains:th".
 + Added new 'config' command to display the configuration settings of task.
   As a consequence 'version' now only shows the version number and legal
   information.
 + The 'config' command now complains about use of deprecated color names in
   your .taskrc file.
 + Added feature #296, that allows the 'config' command to modify your .taskrc
   settings directly, with the command 'task config <name> <value>', or
   'task config <name>' to remove the setting.
 + Task now supports nested .taskrc files using the "include /path" directive.
 + The 'entry', 'start' and 'end' columns now have equivalents that include the
   time, and are called 'entry_time', 'start_time', and 'end_time', for use in
   custom reports.
 + 2 new columns have been added to the reports: countdown and
   countdown_compact.  They show the days left until a task is due or how many
   days a task has been overdue.
 + The new 'priority_long' field can be shown in custom reports, and will
   display 'High' rather than the abbreviated 'H'.
 + Task now supports .taskrc command line overrides using rc.name:value and
   the new rc.name=value to accommodate a frequent mistake.
 + The color rules for projects (color.project.foo) now matches on partial
   project names, the same way as filters.
 + The color command now takes a color as an argument, and displays that color
   with sample text.
 + Added 2 new configuration variables to display the details of tasks with due
   dates when doing a 'task cal' for the corresponding months:
   'calendar.details' and 'calendar.details.report'
 + Added 5 new color configuration variables to colorize today, days with due
   tasks, days with overdue tasks, weekend days and week numbers in the
   calendar:
   'calendar.color.today', 'color.calendar.due', 'calendar.calendar.overdue',
   'color.calendar.weekend'and 'color.calendar.weeknumber'.
 + Added support for holidays in the calendar by using calendar.holidays
   and the corresponding holiday.X.name and holiday.X.date variables.
   The default dateformat being YMD (20101224) set by dateformat.holiday.
 + The coloring of due tasks in reports can now be enabled for all tasks, and
   not only the imminent ones, by setting the configuration variable due=0.
 + Tasks due on the current day ("today") can now have their own color setting
   color.due.today and color.calendar.due.today.
 + Added a new 'task-faq' man page for common questions and answers.
 + Added a new 'task-color' man page detailing how to set up and use color in
   task.
 + Added feature #176, which allows for configurable case-sensitivity for
   keyword searches and substitutions (thanks to John Florian).
 + Task can now use an alternate tag indicator by setting the tag.indicator
   configuration variable to something other than the default of +.
 + Task can now use an alternate active indicator by setting the
   active.indicator configuration variable to something other than the default
   of *.
 + Task can now use an alternate recurrence indicator by setting the
   recurrence.indicator configuration variable to something other than the
   default of R.
 + Added a new file, README.build, which provides assistance troubleshooting
   build-related problems on different operating systems and environments.
 + Fixed bug #316 which caused the timesheet report to display an oddly sorted
   list.
 + Fixed bug #317 which colored tasks in the 'completed' report according to
   due dates, which are no longer relevant to a completed task (thanks to
   Cory Donnelly).
 + Fixed bug #347 which used only a lowercase "all" to confirm multiple changes
   instead of an uppercase "All" like the "Yes" answer.
 + Fixed bug that was causing the 'completed' report to sort incorrectly.
 + Fixed bug that showed a calendar for the year 2037 when 'task calendar due'
   was run, and there are no tasks with due dates.
 + Fixed bug #360 which prevented certain modifications to recurring tasks
   (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #299 which prevented excluding multiple projects from a report,
   by using "task list project.isnt:foo project.isnt:bar" (thanks to John
   Florian).
 + Fixed bug #368 which caused recurring tasks 'until' dates to be rendered as
   epoch numbers instead of dates (thanks to Cory Donnelly).
 + Fixed bug #369 which prevented the config command from setting quoted or
   unquoted multi-word values (thanks to Richard Querin).
 + Fixed bug #370 which prevented the removal of a due date from a task,
   mis-identifying the task as recurring just because it had a due date
   (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #371 which caused task to mis-apply certain color rules, like
   color.alternate, which was (a) not applied first, and (b) not blended
   with the other color rules (thanks to Richard Querin).
 + Fixed bug #372 which incorrectly mapped 16-color backgrounds into the
   256-color space.

1.8.5 (12/05/2009) a6c7236ff34e5eee3ef1693b97cb1367e6e3c607
 + Added feature to allow the user to quit when asked to confirm multiple
   changes.  Now task asks "Proceed with change? (Yes/no/all/quit)".
 + Added feature #341 that makes explicit references to the task and taskrc
   man pages, both in the auto-generated .taskrc file and the version command
   output (thanks to Cory Donnelly).
 + Added feature - #310 that simplified and make clearer an error message
   that complained about things that were beyond user control (thanks to
   John Florian).
 + Fixed bug that was causing the 'completed' report to sort incorrectly.

   to Juergen Daubert).
 + Fixed bug #327 that allowed the removal of a due date from a recurring
   task.

   to due dates, which are no longer relevant to a completed task (thanks
   to Cory Donnelly).
 + Fixed bug that was causing the 'completed' report to sort incorrectly.
 + Fixed bug #322 which failed to propagate rc overrides to shell commands.
 + Fixed redundant messages when exiting shell mode.
 + Fixed bug #333 which failed to display the ID of a duplicated task (thanks
   to Cory Donnelly).
 + Fixed bug #332 where task complained that the 'recur_ind' custom report
   column was invalid.  It was misnamed in the documentation, which should
   have read 'recurrence_indicator'.  Also, the 'tag_indicator' column was
   not mentioned anywhere (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
 + Fixed bug #319 that caused task to not properly detect the removal of a
   tag when obtaining confirmation from the user fora bulk modification
   (thanks to Cory Donnelly).

1.8.4 (11/17/2009) 12c4983936d27317df100f05da8244139dd06a3f
 + Fixed bug that caused wait: dates to not be properly rendered in a
   readable and preferred format with the "edit" command.
 + Fixed bug that caused a hang on cygwin, when a task with multiple
   annotations was edited (thanks to Joe Pulliam).
 + Fixed bug #314 where the edit command fails when data.location includes
   directories containing spaces (thanks to Cory Donnelly).
 + Added a warning (issue #312) when modifying recurring tasks, that all
   instances of that task may be modified.  When task confirms a bulk edit
   the recurrence is again indicated (thanks to Cory Donnelly).

   line to the default command (thanks to Zach Frazier).

1.8.1 (8/20/2009) 35792e7874d2bb664abb1a0a67960b7fe7e0fccf
 + Fixed bug #231 that broke the build on OpenBSD 32-bit due to a time_t
   and int collision (thanks to Pietro Cerutti).
 + Fixed bug #241 that prevented bash's tab-completion of projects in Fedora 
   11 and likely anything using bash-4 (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #242 that sometimes causes the ID echoed after a task is added
   to be incorrect (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #245 that quoted date fields on export, that were subsequently
   improperly parsed on import (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #248 where single and double quotes are both stored as
   ampersand-quot-semi (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #249 that caused annotations with the same date to be lost after
   a "task edit" command (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + Fixed bug #250 whereby rc.dateformat was not observed when parsing the
   creation date of an annotation (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + Fixed bug #251 whereby the presence of annotations cause the .hasnt attribute
   modifier to not work (thanks to John Florian).
 + Fixed bug #252 that prevented use of attribute modifiers on dates to effect
   a range, such as "task ls due.after:eom due.before:eoy" (thanks to John
   Florian).

 + Fixed bug that displays the wrong .taskrc file name on override (thanks to
   Federico Hernandez).
 + Fixed bug that failed to suppress color control code in the header and
   footnote when redirecting output to a file (thanks to John Florian).

1.8.0 (7/21/2009) 14977ef317bd004dae2f2c313e806af9f2a2140c

   of week number in the 'calendar' report (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + Supports '--' argument to indicate that all subsequence arguments are
   part of the description, despite what they otherwise might mean.
 + Removed support for the obsolete task file format 1 (never released).
 + Fixed bug that allowed blank annotations to be added (thanks to Bruce
   Dillahunty).
 + Supports negative tag filters, so that (task list +foo -bar) now filters
   tasks that have the "foo" tag, but do not have the "bar" tag (thanks to
   Chris Pride).
 + Custom reports now support a more compact form of the "age" column,
   called "age_compact" (thanks to T. Charles Yun).

   (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + Removed obsolete DEVELOPERS file.  The online support forums at
   http://taskwarrior.org will provide better information.
 + Fixed bug that kept some deleted tasks showing up on the calendar report
   (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + Now asks the user to confirm large changes if configuration variable
   'confirmation' is set to 'yes'.  A large change is one that completely
   replaces a task description, or operates on a large number of tasks,
   which defaults to 4 but is configurable via the 'bulk' configuration
   variable  (thanks to John Florian).
 + Now echoes back the new task ID on 'add' (thanks to Bruce Dillahunty).
 + The new "shell" command provides an interactive shell for task.  All
   commands are supported (thanks to Bruce Dillahunty, Federico Hernandez,
   and John Florian).
 + New "recurring" report to list all recurring tasks.

 + Now supports colorization of the header and footnote messages that are
   printed before and after report output, with the 'color.header' and
   'color.footnote' configuration variables.
 + Now supports the 'limit' attribute, to control the number of tasks that
   are shown, for example: "task list limit:10".
 + Now supports a debug mode that can be used to generate helpful information
   when reporting a problem.  Just run the command with "task rc.debug:on ..."
   and diagnostics will be generated that will help pinpoint a problem.
 + The new "undo" command replaces the old "undo" and "undelete" command
   with a complete undo stack that can rollback all changes.
 + While waiting for a file lock, task states the reason for the delay.
 + Now supports a 'waiting' state that causes tasks to not appear until
   a certain date, for example "task <ID> wait:<date>".  The task
   will then not show up on any report (except 'all') until that date.
 + The "active", "completed", "overdue" and "next" reports are now custom
   reports, and therefore modifiable.
 + Now supports a 'waiting' custom report to list all waiting tasks.
 + Now supports a 'recurring' custom report to list all recurring tasks.
 + Now supports an 'all' report to list all tasks, including deleted

   a .taskrc entry like "alias.new_name=old_name".
   and completed tasks.
 + Now over 1,600 unit tests, helping to maintain code quality.

 + Improved the errors when parsing a corrupt or unrecognized pending.data
   or completed.data file (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
 + Added details to the "info" report about recurring tasks (thanks to T.
   Charles Yun).
 + Now writes a sample "defaultwidth" configuration variable to the default
   .taskrc file (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
 + Task allows commands that require an ID to now be given a sequence, which
   is a set of IDs.  This allows commands like "task delete 1 2 5-10,12".
 + Fixed bug in the ghistory report, which caused it to only show a new
   month if a task was added during that month.
 + New command "duplicate" which allow existing task(s) to be duplicated,
   and also have modifications applied (thanks to David J Patrick).

   to the task(s) (thanks to David J Patrick).
 + Improved word wrapping in various output.
 + Fixed bug that added an extra line between header and graph in the
   ghistory report.
 + Added simple 'taskprogram' mailing list subscribe form to the web site.
 + For custom reports that define a "limit" to the number of rows of output
   such as "oldest" and "newest", task allows an override value.  For
   example "task oldest 5" will display the 5 oldest tasks.
 + Modified the "stats" report so that it has the same aesthetics as the
   other reports.
 + New "timesheet" command displays tasks completed and started, per week,

 + The task and taskrc man pages are here.  Try "man task", "man taskrc"
   (thanks to Federico Hernandez and P.C. Shyamshankar).
 + Fixed bug that causes task to create a default .task directory, even if
   data.location specified otherwise (thanks to Federico Hernandez).
 + New "edit" command that fires up a text editor (uses 'editor' configuration
   variable, $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variable) and allows direct
   editing of all editable task details.

  + Fixed bug that caused the y/n confirmation on task deletion to ignore the
    Enter key and fail to re-prompt (thanks to Bruce Dillahunty).
  + When the "echo.command" configuration variable is set to "yes", it causes
    commands that modify tasks to display which task was affected (thanks to
    Bruce Dillahunty).
  + A task can now be annotated with the command "task <id> annotate ...", and
    a timestamped annotation will appear in reports.
  + A 'description_only' column is now available for use in custom reports,
    and it excludes annotations.
  + A task can now be upgraded to a recurring task by adding a recurrence
    frequency, a due date, and an optional until date.
  + When a recurring task is modified, all other instances of the recurring
    task are also modified.
  + Custom reports now support user-specified column labels (thanks to T.
    Charles Yun).
  + Task can now import tasks from a variety of data formats, including task
    export files from versions 1.4.3 and earlier, versions 1.5.0 and later,
    todo.sh 2.x, CSV, plain text and task command line.  See online docs for
    full details.
  + Export was including 'id' in the column header even though it was not
    included in the data.
  + The task file format has changed slightly.  Please back up your task
    data files before upgrading to 1.6.0.
  + Added new column 'recurrence_indicator' that displays an 'R' if the task
    is a recurring task.  This column can be added to any custom report.

    has any tags.  This column can be added to any custom report.
  + Fixed bug where sometimes a task description was concatenated oddly if
    there was a colon somewhere in the description.
  + Fixed bug that caused recurring annual tasks to exhibit a creeping due
    date, because of an assumption of 365 days per year, which failed to
    consider leap years (thanks to T. Charles Yun).
  + Annotations can now be modified with the substitution commands /from/to/.
  + Substitutions can now be made global with /from/to/g and all occurrences
    of "from" will be replaced with "to".

    which may be spelling mistakes or deprecated variables.
  + "configure --enable-debug" now supported to suppress compiler optimization
    to allow debugging.
  + Allow lower case priorities, and automatically upper case them.
  + Added support for "due" configuration variable which defines the number
    of days in the future when a task is considered due.
  + Added support for custom reports, comprised of a set of column names and
    sort order, with optional filtering in the configuration file.  This
    means user-defined reports can be written, and the reports currently
    in the configuration file can be renamed.  Several of task's built in
    reports have been converted to user-defined reports.
  + New online documentation for custom reports.
  + New algorithm for determining when the "nag" message is displayed.
  + Fixed bug where task hangs with a certain combination of recurring tasks
    and shadow files.
  + Fixed bug with the task sort algorithm, which led to an unstable sequence
    when there were only a handful of tasks.
  + Performance enhanced by eliminating unnecessary sorting.
  + Task now has a large (and growing) test suite and bug regression tests
    to help ensure higher quality releases.
  + Fixed bug that caused performance hit during table rendering.

    Benjamin Tegarden).
  + Fixed bug that prevented the summary report from properly reporting
    recently completed tasks.

1.4.3 (11/1/2008) 8639e9260646c8c9224e0fc47e5d2443b46eecfc
  + Fixed misleading task count at bottom on "info" report.
  + Added support for a shadow file that contains a plain text task report,
    with the "shadow.file" and "shadow.command" configuration variables.
    The shadow file is automatically updated whenever the task database
    changes.  Useful for integrating with "Samurize".
  + Task now displays a message whenever a shadow file is updated, if the
    "shadow.notify" configuration variable is set "on".
  + Bug: adding a task with a \n, \r or \f in it now fails properly.
  + Removed "usage" command, and support for "command.logging" configuration
    variable.
  + Added documentation for Shadow files.

    the new "default.project" and "default.priority" configuration variables
    (thanks to Vincent Fleuranceau).
  + Task supports improved word-wrapping to the terminal width.
  + Task now supports "default.command" configuration variable (for example
    it could contain "list due:tomorrow") that is the command that is run
    whenever task is invoked with no arguments.
  + Task supports modifying the existing description of a task, with the
    following syntax: task <id> "new description ...".
  + Bug: Now properly supports relative dates in filters (task list due:eom,
    task list due:tomorrow, task list due:23rd ...).
  + Bug: Source now properly includes <string.h> in order to build clean
    using gcc 4.3 (thanks to H. İbrahim Güngör).
